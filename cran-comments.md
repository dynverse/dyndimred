# Resubmission

Changes made:

* Clarified the abbreviation used in the description (PCA).

* Clarified usage of the `install_packages()` function in 
  some of the functions. This will check whether a package is 
  installed and will prompt the user if the package should be
  installed, if it is not.
  
* Extended examples to include all functions, not just a few examples.

# Test environments

* local Fedora 28 installation, R 3.6
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
